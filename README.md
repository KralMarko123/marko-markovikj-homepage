# [Marko's Homepage](https://marko-markovikj-homepage.vercel.app/)

Welcome to my homepage! This was something I tried to follow along and learn from _[devaslife's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7yZ6keOGsvERMp2HaEbbXQ)_ tutorial.
You can find it [**HERE.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSMZgXzC9AA)

I am by no means a UI designer so I'm constantly looking for inspiration and ways to learn something new. With the help of this video I found a nice template to try and
make my homepage from while also practicing my React skills and learning some new tools like Blender ( those took a long time ) and Framer Motion. 
All credit goes to Takuyama for his amazing videos and unique designs. (PS. I asked him about using the site as a template and he gave me his blessing :D)
